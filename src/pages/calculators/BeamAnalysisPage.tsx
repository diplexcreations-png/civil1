        { question: 'What load types are supported?', answer: 'The calculator supports uniformly distributed loads (UDL) in kN/m or lb/ft and point loads at midspan. Both can be combined for composite loading analysis.' },
        { question: 'How is deflection calculated?', answer: 'Maximum elastic deflection is computed using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory: Δ = 5wL⁴/384EI for UDL and Δ = PL³/48EI for point loads. Results are checked against L/240 serviceability limits.' },
        { question: 'What beam properties are required?', answer: 'You need the beam span length, elastic modulus (E), and moment of inertia (I). For concrete beams, the calculator provides standard E values based on the concrete grade (f\'c).' },
