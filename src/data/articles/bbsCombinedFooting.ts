    h1: 'Bar Bending Schedule for Combined Footing — Complete Engineering Guide with Top & Bottom Mesh Reinforcement',
    introduction: `A combined footing is a reinforced concrete foundation that supports two or more columns on a single rectangular or trapezoidal slab. Combined footings become necessary when property line constraints prevent independent isolated footings for each column, or when adjacent columns are so close that their individual footings would overlap. The reinforcement in a combined footing is significantly more complex than an isolated footing because it must resist both positive bending moments (sagging) between the columns and negative bending moments (hogging) at the column locations. This requires both a bottom mesh and a top mesh of reinforcement, each with its own main and distribution bars.

The bar bending schedule for a combined footing must therefore account for two distinct reinforcement layers. The bottom mesh, placed near the bottom face of the footing, resists the positive bending moment that causes the footing to sag between the columns. The top mesh, placed near the top face, resists the negative bending moment that causes hogging at the column supports. Each mesh has main bars running in one direction and distribution bars in the perpendicular direction, with bar diameters, spacing, and lengths that reflect the moment demand at that location. The CivILMath BBS Combined Footing calculator handles this complexity by allowing the user to define separate parameters for the bottom and top meshes within each footing section.

In practice, combined footings are designed as either rectangular or trapezoidal in plan. A rectangular combined footing is used when the two columns carry approximately equal loads. A trapezoidal combined footing is used when the outer column has a significantly larger load, requiring a wider footing at that end to keep the bearing pressure uniform. Each column location may also require additional reinforcement in the form of extra bars or closer spacing in the vicinity of the column. The BBS must capture these details precisely because the bending moment diagram of a combined footing varies nonlinearly along its length, and the reinforcement must be placed where the demand is greatest.

This article provides a comprehensive treatment of combined footing BBS calculations. We cover the structural theory, the input parameters for top and bottom mesh, the calculation logic for multi-section footings, detailed formulas with code references, a fully worked step-by-step example for a rectangular combined footing supporting two columns, and an extensive catalogue of common errors, best practices, and frequently asked questions drawn from real-world design and construction experience. Whether you are designing a combined footing for a commercial building, an industrial foundation, or a bridge abutment, this guide will ensure your BBS is accurate, code-compliant, and site-ready.`,
    theory: `The structural behaviour of a combined footing is analogous to an inverted T-beam or a continuous beam on elastic supports. The footing spans between columns, with the columns acting as supports and the soil reaction acting as a distributed upward load. The bending moment diagram shows positive (sagging) moment in the span between columns and negative (hogging) moment at the column locations. The magnitude of these moments depends on the column loads, the spacing between columns, and the footing dimensions. The reinforcement design follows the moment envelope: bottom bars are concentrated in the positive moment regions, and top bars in the negative moment regions.

From a BBS perspective, a combined footing is modelled as one or more rectangular sections, each with its own length, width, thickness, and cover. For each section, the user independently enables or disables the bottom mesh and top mesh, and specifies the main bar diameter, main bar spacing, distribution bar diameter, and distribution bar spacing for each mesh. This sectional approach allows the BBS to accurately represent footings with varying width (trapezoidal) or varying depth (stepped) without requiring a single monolithic calculation that ignores geometric transitions.

The number of bars in each mesh is calculated using the same formula as for isolated footings: N = ceil(effective_dimension / spacing) + 1, ensuring the first and last bars are at half-spacing from the edge. However, for combined footings, the effective length and width for the top mesh may differ from those for the bottom mesh if the cover is different or if the top mesh does not extend the full length of the footing (curtailment). The CivILMath calculator uses the section dimensions consistently for both meshes, but the user can specify different bar diameters and spacing for each mesh independently.

The hook length for both top and bottom mesh bars is derived from the clear thickness of the footing: hook = thickness − 2 × cover. This is consistent with shape code 21 (hooks at both ends) which is the standard for footing mats. For the distribution bars, the hook length is the same as for the main bars because they share the same section thickness. The bend deduction for each bar is calculated per the selected design standard, accounting for the bar diameter and the bending radius specific to that standard.

The concrete volume of the combined footing is the sum of L × W × thickness for each defined section. The total steel weight aggregates all bars from all sections and all meshes, providing a complete project-level material take-off. The weight is also broken down by bar diameter, which is critical for procurement since a combined footing typically uses multiple bar sizes (e.g., T16 for bottom main, T12 for bottom distribution, T12 or T16 for top mesh).`,

    calculationLogic: `The CivILMath combined footing calculator processes each defined footing section sequentially. For each section, the engine extracts the geometric parameters (length, width, thickness, cover) and the reinforcement parameters for the bottom and top meshes. The calculation follows a consistent sequence: effective clear dimensions are computed, bar counts are determined from spacing, cutting lengths are calculated using shape codes with hooks, and steel weights are aggregated.

For the bottom mesh, the clear length (effective span for main bars) is the section length minus twice the cover, and the clear width (for distribution bars) is the section width minus twice the cover. The bottom main bars run along the length direction, so their number is derived from the width dimension: N_bot_main = ceil(W_effective / s_bot_main) + 1. The bottom distribution bars run along the width direction, so their number comes from the length dimension: N_bot_dist = ceil(L_effective / s_bot_dist) + 1. The same approach applies to the top mesh, using the top-specific bar diameters and spacing values.

The cutting length for every bar uses shape code 21 (BS 8666), which represents a bar with a hook at each end. For the main bars, the straight segment B equals the effective clear length L_effective, and the hooks A and C equal the clear thickness of the section (thickness − 2 × cover). The bend deduction for two 90° bends is applied per the selected design standard. The engine also supports shape code 11 (straight bar with one hook) for situations where only one end requires a hook, though this is rare for footing mats.

The concrete volume is calculated as the sum of L × W × thickness for each section. The total steel weight sums all bar types across all sections, and a weight-by-diameter summary is provided. The engine also generates unique bar marks for each reinforcement type, using the section label as a prefix (e.g., F1-B1 for section F1 bottom main, F1-B2 for section F1 bottom distribution, F1-T1 for section F1 top main, F1-T2 for section F1 top distribution). This enables clear traceability in the BMS (Bar Marking System) for fabrication and site installation.`,

    resultExplanation: `The BBS output for a combined footing is a tabular schedule with rows for each reinforcement type across all defined sections. Each row includes a unique bar mark that combines the section label and a suffix indicating the mesh and orientation — for example, "F1-B1" for Section 1 Bottom Main, "F1-B2" for Section 1 Bottom Distribution, "F1-T1" for Section 1 Top Main, and "F1-T2" for Section 1 Top Distribution. This naming convention ensures that every bar on site can be traced back to its exact location in the footing.

The cutting lengths reflect the shape code 21 configuration with hooks at both ends. The A and C dimensions are both equal to the clear thickness (thickness minus twice the cover), which is consistent across all bars in a given section. The B dimension is either the effective length (for main bars) or the effective width (for distribution bars). Site engineers should verify that these B dimensions match the as-built formwork dimensions before ordering steel.

The concrete volume reported is the sum of all section volumes. For trapezoidal combined footings, the user should model the footing as multiple rectangular sections of varying width; the total concrete volume will be the sum of these sections, which approximates the true trapezoidal volume. For precise take-off, the user can also manually compute the trapezoidal volume and compare it with the calculator sum.

The weight-by-diameter breakdown is especially useful for procurement. A combined footing typically uses three or four different bar diameters (e.g., T20, T16, T12 in this example). The breakdown tells the procurement team exactly how many tonnes of each diameter to order. Discrepancies between the total weight on the BBS and the structural drawing's bar list should always be investigated before fabrication proceeds.`,

      'Always model the combined footing as individual sections that match the structural engineer\'s design drawings. Do not combine sections arbitrarily.',
      'Use clear, logical section labels (e.g., "Bay1", "Bay2") that correspond to the drawing grid lines. Avoid generic labels like "Section 1" that are hard to trace on site.',
      'Enable both top and bottom meshes for the full length of combined footings unless the structural engineer specifically allows curtailment of the top mesh.',
      'Verify that the bar spacing in both meshes allows concrete to flow freely through the reinforcement cage. Use spacing ≥ 100 mm and not less than the maximum aggregate size plus 5 mm.',
      'Always include chair supports for the top mesh when the footing thickness exceeds 500 mm. Use T10 or T12 bars in a 1.0 m × 1.0 m grid pattern.',
      'Check the weight-by-diameter breakdown against the structural engineer\'s bar list. Any discrepancy of more than 3% should be investigated.',
      'Use 5% waste allowance for all ordered steel quantities. Combined footings with multiple bar sizes tend to generate more off-cuts than simple footings.',
      'Maintain a clear distinction between the number of sections (sub-parts of one footing) and the number of members (identical footings). This prevents order-of-magnitude errors in quantity.',
      'For trapezoidal combined footings, use at least 3–4 constant-width sections to approximate the trapezoid. More sections give better accuracy.',
      'Cross-check the cutting lengths against the formwork dimensions. The bars should fit comfortably within the formwork with the specified cover maintained on all sides.',
      'Include starter bar dowels for each column on the combined footing as separate BBS items. The dowel diameter and spacing should match the column vertical bars.',
      'Use the maximum bar diameter that fits within the section thickness to reduce congestion. Follow the detailing rules for bar spacing at column junctions.',
      'Prepare a bar location diagram alongside the BBS table. Show which bars belong to which mesh and which direction, especially when both meshes have different diameters.',

    faqs: [
      { question: 'What is a combined footing and when is it used?', answer: 'A combined footing supports two or more columns on a single slab. It is used when individual footings would overlap, when a column is at the property line, or when soil conditions require a larger foundation area to limit bearing pressure.' },
      { question: 'Why does a combined footing need both top and bottom reinforcement?', answer: 'A combined footing experiences both positive (sagging) moment between columns and negative (hogging) moment over the columns. The bottom mesh resists positive moment, and the top mesh resists negative moment. Omitting either mesh leads to structural failure.' },
      { question: 'How is a trapezoidal combined footing modelled in the BBS?', answer: 'A trapezoidal footing is modelled as multiple rectangular sections with linearly varying widths. Each section is treated independently in the BBS with its own bar diameters and spacing.' },
      { question: 'What shape code is used for combined footing bars?', answer: 'Shape code 21 (hooks at both ends) is the standard for both top and bottom mesh bars in combined footings. Shape code 11 (straight bar with one hook) may be used for distribution bars if anchorage conditions permit.' },
      { question: 'How does the number of sections affect the BBS output?', answer: 'Each section generates its own set of bar marks (e.g., F1-B1, F2-B1). The total steel and concrete are summed across all sections. More sections mean more bar marks but better accuracy for variable-width footings.' },
      { question: 'What is a strap combined footing?', answer: 'A strap (cantilever) combined footing uses a beam to connect an eccentrically loaded footing to an interior footing, allowing them to act together without a full slab between them. The strap beam requires its own BBS.' },
      { question: 'Can the top mesh have different bar diameters than the bottom mesh?', answer: 'Yes. The top and bottom meshes are independently configurable because they resist different moment magnitudes. Typically, the bottom mesh has larger diameter bars for positive moment, and the top mesh may be lighter.' },
      { question: 'What is the minimum reinforcement ratio for a combined footing?', answer: 'For temperature and shrinkage: 0.12% of gross area (IS 456 for HYSD) or 0.0018 × b × h (ACI 318). For structural reinforcement, the ratio must satisfy the design moment demand.' },
      { question: 'How is the concrete volume calculated for a combined footing with multiple sections?', answer: 'Each section\'s volume = L × W × thickness. Total volume = sum of all section volumes. For trapezoidal footings modelled with multiple rectangular sections, this gives an accurate approximation.' },
      { question: 'Do I need chair supports for combined footings?', answer: 'Yes, if the footing thickness exceeds 500 mm, chair supports are required to hold the top mesh at the correct elevation. Chairs are typically T10 or T12 bars in a 1.0 m × 1.0 m grid.' },
      { question: 'What is the typical clear cover for a combined footing?', answer: 'For concrete cast against soil, minimum cover is 50 mm (IS 456) or 75 mm (ACI 318). For combined footings with a blinding layer, 50 mm is typical for moderate exposure conditions.' },
      { question: 'How are starter bars (dowels) included in the combined footing BBS?', answer: 'Starter bars are separate items. They extend from the footing into the column, with a lap length above the footing and a hook or bend embedded in the footing. They are not part of the mesh reinforcement.' },
      { question: 'What is the maximum bar spacing allowed in a combined footing?', answer: 'Per ACI 318, maximum spacing = 3 × thickness or 450 mm, whichever is less. Per IS 456, spacing should not exceed 3 × effective depth or 300 mm for main reinforcement.' },
      { question: 'How do I handle a combined footing with three or more columns?', answer: 'Model it as a continuous section with the total length covering all columns. Define each column location for reference, but the BBS treats the entire slab as one or more sections with continuous reinforcement.' },
      { question: 'What is the difference between "bottom main" and "bottom distribution" bars?', answer: 'Bottom main bars run along the length of the footing and resist the primary bending moment. Bottom distribution bars run along the width and serve to spread the load and control cracking.' },
      { question: 'Can the calculator handle imperial units for combined footings?', answer: 'Yes. Toggle the unit switch to imperial. Bar sizes are mapped to imperial numbers (e.g., T16 → #5). All dimensions, spacing, and cutting lengths are in inches and feet.' },
      { question: 'How accurate is the sectional approach for trapezoidal footings?', answer: 'Using 4–6 constant-width sections approximates a trapezoidal footing to within 2–3% of the true volume and steel weight. More sections increase accuracy but also increase BBS complexity.' },
      { question: 'What does the bar mark "F1-T2" mean?', answer: 'F1 = section label (Footing Section 1), T = Top mesh, 2 = Distribution bars. So F1-T2 is the top distribution reinforcement for section 1.' },
      { question: 'How is the waste allowance applied to combined footing BBS?', answer: 'Waste (typically 5%) is added to the total steel weight after summing all sections. It is not applied per-section because off-cuts from one section may be usable in another.' },
      { question: 'What if the structural design calls for extra bars at column locations?', answer: 'These should be added as separate BBS items with their own bar marks (e.g., F1-E1 for extra bars at column 1). The calculator does not automatically generate these — they must be added based on the design drawings.' }
